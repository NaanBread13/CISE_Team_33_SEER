# CISE_Team_33_SEER
SEER Database project for Assignment 1B of Contemporary Methods of Software Engineering. The purpose of this assignment was to learn and get practice at the techniques, 
tools and skills needed to collaboratively develop software using an Agile way of working from requirements discovery to application deployment.

This project was developed in **MongoDB**, **React**, **Express** and **NodeJS**. We also used **SCRUM** as our way of working for this project. 

# What is SEER?
SEER is the Software Engineering Evidence Repository. It is a searchable database of evidence curated by "SE Experts" on the different SE practices that developers can use to 
develop their product.

# What does SEER do?
A user is able to search and add evidence records to the SEER database. For example, A user wants to find whether TDD is a good way of working. 
They would be able to search about TDD in the database and get a list of peer-reviewed research articles
about TDD, with a summary about what measures and results came from the study on TDD.
Secondly, a user is able to add an evidence record to the database. A user will provide details for the evidence record such as Author, the peer-reviewed article link
etc. Once the user submits this record, a moderator makes sure that this record is peer-reviewed and relevant to SE. If so, 
the Moderator accepts the record and it is passed onto the Analyst who extracts, creates a summary of the information and uploads it to the SEER database.
